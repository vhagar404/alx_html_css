# Headphones Website — README

Welcome to the **Headphones** project! This project is part of the **ALX HTML & CSS curriculum**, focusing on translating a Figma design into a fully responsive, pixel-perfect web page.

This README provides everything you need to understand, build, and present the project professionally.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to recreate a beautifully designed website based on a Figma file. By the end, you should be able to:

* Understand and interpret UI/UX design details from Figma
* Translate design specifications into clean and organized HTML/CSS
* Build responsive layouts for desktop and mobile (≤ 480px)
* Apply interaction states (hover/active)
* Follow best practices in file structure and version control

---

## 🎨 Figma Design

Before starting the project:

1. **Create a Figma account** — if you don’t already have one.
2. Open the design file provided by ALX and click **“Duplicate to your Drafts”**.
3. This gives you full access to:

   * Layout spacing
   * Colors
   * Font sizes and weights
   * Icons and images
   * Component interactions

### 🔗 Font Requirements

If your computer doesn’t have the fonts used in the design, download them here:

* **Source Sans Pro**
* **Spin Cycle OT**

(Some values may appear as floats in Figma—feel free to round them.)

## 📁 Project Structure

Your project must follow this structure inside the **`alx_html_css`** repository:

```
alx_html_css/
└── headphones/
    ├── README.md
    ├── index.html
    ├── styles.css
    ├── images/
    │   ├── header.jpg
    │   ├── icons/*.svg
    │   └── ...
    └── other assets...
```

---

## 📱 Responsive Behaviour

The website must automatically switch to mobile layout when the screen width is **480px or less**.

### Mobile Requirements:

* Layout stacks vertically where necessary
* Text and images adjust to smaller screens
* Navigation adapts (hamburger or vertical layout)
* Content remains readable and well spaced

---

## 🖱️ Interactions & Styling Rules

Follow these interaction styles exactly:

### 🔗 Links

* **Hover/Active color:** `#FF6565`

### 🔘 Buttons

* **Hover/Active:** `opacity: 0.9`

### 🧱 Layout Constraint

* **Max content width:** 1000px (centered horizontally)

## 🏗️ How to Use Figma for This Project

1. Inspect properties using `⌥` (Alt) or `I` (Inspect mode)
2. Copy font sizes, colors, spacing exactly
3. Export images/icons from Figma in the correct format
4. Recreate auto-layout spacing manually in CSS

---
