# CSS Advanced — ALX Frontend Project

This repository contains the solution for the ALX **CSS Advanced** project.

The goal is to reproduce a full webpage layout using:
- clean semantic HTML,
- advanced CSS styling,
- Figma design reference,
- responsive mobile-first structure.

This project builds directly on the "HTML, Advanced" project.  
You must rewrite the HTML provided previously into a fully styled webpage following the given design.

## 📁 Project Structure

All required files must be inside **this repository**:
css_advanced/
│
├── README.md
├── index.html
└── images/

- `index.html` → contains the full HTML structure.
- `styles.css` → contains all CSS styling.
- `images/` → contains all images used in the design.

### **HTML**
- Use the HTML provided in the “HTML Advanced” project.
- Update tags, classes, attributes as needed to match the Figma design.
